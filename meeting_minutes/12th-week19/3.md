# Week 19/3 - Meeting Minutes

would be organized after meeting... 

## 12th Meeting: 24/01/22 - Mon

time: 14:00 - 14:30

## Things Agreed & Acknowledged

1. Any decision made if any other attempts could tried, might be included later in the conclusion part (reflection, any insufficiency, or anything could be promoted)
2. Might want to first experiment with the ASM frameworks even with the simplest program i.e. hello world. Prepare for the code generation.

## Before Next Meeting

* Orgnize minutes of this week
* Continue work on the remaining contextual things
    * pointers
    * IO builtin procedures/functions i.e. read, write
* Experiment with ASM frameworks
  * find out how to manually write a Hello World bytecode file
* Reading JVM specification (JDK11)
    * after this should be able to learn the **ASM** frameworks which is possible to be integrated with **ANTLR** to generate the bytecode file
* (If have time) Might organise current regression tests into single units then applying batch contextual analysis testing
