would be organized after meeting...

## 19th Meeting: 21/03/22 - Mon

time: 14:00 - 14:30

## Things Mentioned

* It is okay to mentioned other compilers development work in the background part though the specific compiler may not be evaluated later on
* Implementation part, when mentioned JVM instruction (how specific constructs to be done using bytecode), describing the pattern in a more general way
  * rather than list everything, for example I used iadd, iload for expression
  * might be good to catergorise the instructions...
