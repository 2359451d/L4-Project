# 1st Meeting: 04/10/21 - Mon

time: 12:00 - 12:30

# Things Agreed & Acknowledged

* if got time, try to **extend the project**
  * start from the direction of extended Pascal feature
  * ![](/static/2021-10-04-21-32-24.png)
  * or other possibility - integrates this compiler into IDE (plugin component? - anyway might be lots work to do)
* in semester 2, would mainly focus on the dissertation writing
* **when would be the best time to send the draft**?
  * ensure enough time being left, and sent before the deadline as time goes
  * then got enough time to revise and discuss further
* **should plan myself the project things as time goes**
  * progress each week
  * progress each semester
  * balance the workload, and assess the progress difference between weeks, (to see whether certain week left too much things to do...)
* **How much extent should know Pascal**
  * just like other PL, basic constructs
  * NOTE: the pointer types might be tricky to deal with, cause' the pointer types of Pascal not similar to what we have in C. (implemented more bottom-level as Java?)
* **How much extent should I know about the JVM/bytecode/class file**
  * target - able to emit JVM bytecode, and study the concepts along the way
* **two ways to convert a token stream into an AST: Top-down(ANTLR) & Bottom-up methods, which one to choose and should all of them being metioned in dissertation?**
  * dissertation things left here for now. But ANTLR use the top-down method, might be straightforward
* **ANTLR is powerful compared to other automation tool, so can just choose ANTLR**
* **the tree walkers could be implemented in Visitor pattern(more straightforward)**
  * but can have a look of Listener pattern if interested
* **Things would be coverd in dissertation now left, would be mainly disscussed later on**
* most challenging part
  * it depends
* **should this compiler being written in JAVA**
  * depends but I'm familar with JAVA
  * NOTE: consider the bootstraping compiler...might first have a compiler "Pascal to JVM" written in JAVA, then reversely have a compiler "Pascal to JVM" written in Pascal for bootstraping...
    * might be tricky...
* might be useful to record each problem encounter (how to address) & each decision made (why)
  * prepared for the dissertation

# Before Next Meeting

* Organize previous meeting minutes
* finished revising the PL course
* take a loo in suggested book(*Programming language processors in java*)
* have a general plan for each week (an overview)
  * then for each week could find the right direction to follow and focus
