# 4th Meeting: 25/10/21 - Mon

time: 12:00 - 12:30

# Things Agreed & Acknowledged

1. **Is that worth mentioning ANTLR4 features (supporting left recursive, `ALL(*)`) against other automation tools though the dissertation should focus on compiler itself**

* Just mention ANTLR is powerful. Enable us generating the compiler components automatically without other operations.
* Contrast to other old tools, when addressing the ambiguity problem, it may involve writing the rules for each alternative. While ANTLR could resolve the ambiguity problem by left recursive.

2. Experiment the existing Pascal grammar with exmaples from books
3. Focus the book of current stage rather than try to finish several looking once.

# Before Next Meeting

* Organize previous meeting minutes
* Experiment with the existing Pascal grammar, if does not work try to amend it.
    * generate the lexer & parser - contactic analysis
* Finish looking of book *The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference*
