## Week 9

### 15 Nov 2021

### 20 Nov 2021

* *1 hour* Refine Symbol table & continue work on contextual analysis
* *1 hour* Research about java compiler (static vairable space, how allocation works)
  * check whether this could somehow relate to Type Descriptor design (like is there any other information need to provide to the code generation stage). But seems there is no correlation for now...I suppose JVM would do the majority part of the vairable allocation...(variable size .etc)

### 21 Nov 2021

* *3 hours* Research more about symbol table & design pattern things. Label Pascal grammar for usage (there exists some confusing alternatives)

## Week 10

### 22 Nov 2021

* *0.5 hour* Hold the 8th meeting with supervisor

### 23 Nov 2021

* *0.5 hour* Research about Run-time lib of Pascal (How to conduct the contexual analysis when there are overloaded RTL defined, and the parameters are untyped implicitly)

### 27 Nov 2021

* *1 hour* Reorganise the project structure (it is not possible to build mixed-language project in IDEA, so about to process them seperately)
* *1 hour* Research about RTL(no gain), might worth researching more about overload resolution & parametric polymorphism, also check how others implementing compilers (especially how they deal with RTL builtin functions & overloaded). Suppose gonna refer the existing compiler RTL docs reference and write a "RTL" (support for symbol table)
* *0.5 hour* Same as above but organise again those blockers encountered in this stage, also some assumptions (at least try to make it work... mainly struggling about Func/Proc overloadded signatures [how to design a suitable type descriptor] & builtin Func/Proc [how exactly these defined in standard Pascal: overloaded signatures and arguments type restrictions...])

### 28 Nov 2021

* *0.5 hour* Research about the possible books which might help (more praticle examples, as currently blocked somehow in contextual analysis)
* *1.5 hours* Quick Look into how others process RT builtin func/proc when conducting semantic analysis
* *0.5 hour* Explore the design patterns for RTL (JVMClass should be a good reference, but would choose the straightforward implementation for now as still in experiment stage) 
* *4.5 hours* Contexual analysis coding
