## Guidance

* This file contains the time log for your project. It will be submitted along with your final dissertation.
* **YOU MUST KEEP THIS UP TO DATE AND UNDER VERSION CONTROL.**
* This timelog should be filled out honestly, regularly (daily) and accurately. It is for *your* benefit.
* Follow the structure provided, grouping time by weeks.  Quantise time to the half hour.

## Week 1

### 21 Sep 2021

* *8 hours* Go over proposed projects and made decision

## Week 2

### 27 Sep 2021

* *3 hours* Read the project guidance notes and other information given on moodle
* *1 hour* Set up Github level 4 dissertation & record & source-code repository and essential documents and information added(timelog, status_report)
* *1 hour* Create issues & milestones related to each level 4 repo

### 28 Sep 2021

* *1 hour* Look through the basic concepts of how java programes converted into bytecodes (what's the role of JVM in this process) and hello world example of how to analyze the bytecodes
* *1 hour* Fix submodule indexing problem, removed the submodules of other repos as it always related to the attached HEAD
* *2 hours* Write the questions for meeting later on, regarding the general questions and project-related question (starting point etc.)

### 30 Sep 2021

* *1 hour* Revise PL course

### 3 Oct 2021

* *3 hours* Revise PL course

## Week 3

### 4 Oct 2021

* *3 hours* Revise PL course & prepare the weekly report(quetions, progress) for the supervisor meeting
* *0.5 hour* Hold the 1st meeting with the supervisor
* *0.5 hour* Organise the 1st meeting minutes

### 9 Oct 2021

* *5 hours* Revise PL course & other basic concepts (DFA, NFA, CFG)

## Week 4

### 11 Oct 2021

* *0.5 hour* Hold the 2nd meeting with the supervisor
* *0.5 hour* Organise the 2nd meeting minutes

### 16 Oct 2021

* *5 hours* Research through ANTLR, AST design patterns(interpreter, visitor, decorator etc.)

### 17 Oct 2021

* *1 hour* Research through ANTLR and revise Calc grammar and driver class. (think about the possibility of visualisation of the AST i.e. using existing library or something else)

## Week 5

### 18 Oct 2021

* *0.5 hour* Hold the 3rd meeting with the supervisor

### 24 Oct 2021

* *5 hours* Research about ANTLR & read book *The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference*

## Week 6

### 25 Oct 2021

* *0.5 hour* Organise the 3rd meeting minutes
* *0.5 hour* Hold the 4th meeting with the supervisor

### 31 Oct 2021

* *0.5 hour* Organise the 4th meeting minutes

## Week 7

### 25 Oct 2021

* *0.5 hour* Hold the 5th meeting with the supervisor

### 6 Nov 2021

* *1 hour* Read the book *The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference*

### 7 Nov 2021

* *2 hours* Read the book *The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference*
* *0.5 hour* Organise the 5th meeting minutes

## Week 8

### 8 Nov 2021

* *0.5 hour* Hold the 6th meeting with the supervisor

### 13 Nov 2021

* *0.5 hour* Organise the 6th meeting minutes
* *2 hours* Setup basic files for source-code repo
  * might re-orgnise as goes, build guidance & scripts etc. to be done
  * currently components generated by IDEA-plugin(time-saving), where might worth using **antlr4-docker image** or the ordinary **jar file** to experiment with
* *3 hours* Revise docker, writing dockerfile & scripts for building antlr4

### 14 Nov 2021

* *1 hour* Organise source code repo

## Week 9

### 15 Nov 2021

* *0.5 hour* Hold the 7th meeting with the supervisor

### 20 Nov 2021

* *1 hour* Refine Symbol table & continue work on contextual analysis
* *1 hour* Research about java compiler (static vairable space, how allocation works)
  * check whether this could somehow relate to Type Descriptor design (like is there any other information need to provide to the code generation stage). But seems there is no correlation for now...I suppose JVM would do the majority part of the vairable allocation...(variable size .etc)

### 21 Nov 2021

* *3 hours* Research more about symbol table & design pattern things. Label Pascal grammar for usage (there exists some confusing alternatives)

## Week 10

### 22 Nov 2021

* *0.5 hour* Hold the 8th meeting with supervisor

### 23 Nov 2021

* *0.5 hour* Research about Run-time lib of Pascal (How to conduct the contexual analysis when there are overloaded RTL defined, and the parameters are untyped implicitly)

### 27 Nov 2021

* *1 hour* Reorganise the project structure (it is not possible to build mixed-language project in IDEA, so about to process them seperately)
* *1 hour* Research about RTL(no gain), might worth researching more about overload resolution & parametric polymorphism, also check how others implementing compilers (especially how they deal with RTL builtin functions & overloaded). Suppose gonna refer the existing compiler RTL docs reference and write a "RTL" (support for symbol table)
* *0.5 hour* Same as above but organise again those blockers encountered in this stage, also some assumptions (at least try to make it work... mainly struggling about Func/Proc overloadded signatures [how to design a suitable type descriptor] & builtin Func/Proc [how exactly these defined in standard Pascal: overloaded signatures and arguments type restrictions...])

### 28 Nov 2021

* *0.5 hour* Research about the possible books which might help (more praticle examples, as currently blocked somehow in contextual analysis)
* *1.5 hours* Quick Look into how others process RT builtin func/proc when conducting semantic analysis
