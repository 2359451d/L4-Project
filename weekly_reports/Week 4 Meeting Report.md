# Week 4 - Meeting Report

Time: 11/10/2021 Mon 12:00-12:30

# Week 3 - Recap

previous week we went through:

* points of the meeting(arrangements .etc )
* basic points of JVM & Pascal (how much extent should know and the target)
* possible project extention direction
    * extended Pascal feature
    * integration to the IDE
    * .etc

also mentioned that should have a general plan to assess the progress week by week (whether too slow or something else) 

# Week 3 - Progress

* done revision of the PL course
* week-by-week plan for this semester
* start looking in the book *Programming language processors in Java*

# Questions

## Project-Related Questions

> Pascal to JVM compiler
> 
> The aim is to design and implement a compiler for the classic programming language Pascal (or another language), using Java Virtual Machine code as the target language. If time permits, language extensions can be explored.
> 
> Ideally the student will have taken PL(H). This project is an opportunity to put the concepts and techniques of that course into practice, as well as gaining an in-depth knowledge of the Java Virtual Machine.

1. Could the **intermediate code optimisation** be one of the extended direction or shall just let JVM process the intermediate code directly

2. Shall I go deep through the concepts of **NFA**(nondeterministic finite automaton & **DFA**(deterministic finite automaton) in syntatic analysis stage

* i.e. was this worth methioning in the dissertation though I'd assume all this concepts are being handled by the automation tools...

3. Shall I go deep through the **LL(1) parsing algorithm** of the top-down construction method?

* i.e. was this worth methioning in the dissertaion... like to describe how exactly the top-down method being implemented

4. Is the **Code Transformation** to the AST generated by the parser needed?

# This week Plan (After Meeting)

* Orgnize minutes of this week
* quick look into the details of pervious coursework implementation
    * class structures
    * how address table & type table being processed
* continue looking in the suggested book (*Programming language processors in Java*)

# Week 4 - Meeting Minutes

would be organized after meeting... 

## 2nd Meeting: 11/10/21 - Mon

time: 12:00 - 12:30

## Things Agreed & Acknowledged

1. Should refine the week-by-week plan in details

* start working on the ANTLR & JVM things in a few weeks, do not leave them at the very end
* start experiment with the small Pascal compiler example, have a try whether it works or not

2. Might would like to research more about the JVM (structures, feature, difference to other VM etc.), it is obviously worth mentioning in the dissertation 

2. Could the **intermediate code optimisation** be one of the extended direction or shall just let JVM process the intermediate code directly

* yes, might be a possibility

4. Shall I go deep through the concepts of **NFA**(nondeterministic finite automaton & **DFA**(deterministic finite automaton) in syntatic analysis stage

* i.e. was this worth methioning in the dissertation though I'd assume all this concepts are being handled by the automation tools...
* no, as ANTLR is powerful enough and assume these concepts could be skiped now

5. Shall I go deep through the **LL(1) parsing algorithm** of the top-down construction method?

* i.e. was this worth methioning in the dissertaion... like to describe how exactly the top-down method being implemented
* same as above, but might worth constrast the difference between **top-down** and **bottom-up costruction** methods.

6. Is the **Code Transformation** to the AST generated by the parser needed?

* the AST should already be ready after the type table processed, so further code transformation might not be needed

## Before Next Meeting

* Organize previous meeting minutes
* Continue looking in the suggested books
* Quick look into the details of pervious coursework implementation
    * class structures
    * how address table & type table being processed
* Experiment with the basic/simple Pascal compiler example, see if works or not
    * lexer, parser
