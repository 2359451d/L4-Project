# Questions

## General Questions

1. How should I address you?

2. Is that alright we just keep this form of weekly meeting for now? Or shall I send you emails to confirm the meeting arrangements before the meeting just in case you are busy and the arrangements might be changed?

3. Is that alright that I show my weekly report in this way
    * bring the printed documents to the in-person meeting
    * show the slides or markdown file if we have a remote meeting

4. If we have a remote meeting, may I record our meeting for the minutes as I might kind of lose track of some words.

5. Is that alright I public all the level 4 project repositoreis in Github?

6. Currently I've set up 3 repos for the project (with soft links to quick access each other). Is this ok or would you suggest integrate everything in one repository.

7. I'm curious about when would majority of students start working on the dissertation draft?
    * Was that after all the source code finalised i.e. Semester 2...

8. When would be the best time to send you the draft before the deadline?
    * like 2 weeks ahead or ... 

9. Is there any other things that should be awared of?
    * like how much the compiler should be completed this semester, considering the workload of coursework would accumulate later on 


## Project-Related Questions

> Pascal to JVM compiler
> 
> The aim is to design and implement a compiler for the classic programming language Pascal (or another language), using Java Virtual Machine code as the target language. If time permits, language extensions can be explored.
> 
> Ideally the student will have taken PL(H). This project is an opportunity to put the concepts and techniques of that course into practice, as well as gaining an in-depth knowledge of the Java Virtual Machine.

4. Should the Pascal to JVM compiler being written in Java?
    * Similar to what we have done in PL coursework...

5. It said that there is two ways to converts a token stream into an AST: Top-Down(Recursive descent parsing) & Bottom-up methods, should all of them being implemented and covered in the dissertation?

6. Shall I use the automation tool to generate the compiler components or implement them manually?
    * And if allowed, should I try other tool(lex yacc, javacc) or ANTLR is enough

7. Shall I implement the tree walkers in both Visitor pattern and Listener pattern and mentioned in dissertation?

8. Would the dissertation focus on how the compiler implemented in each stage or something else as it is a research style project

9. what would be the most challenging part of this project?
    * I recall in PL coursework it took some thinking when processing the address in code generation stage...
