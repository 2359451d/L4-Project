# Week 7 - Meeting Report

Time: 01/11/2021 Mon 12:00-12:30

# Week 6 - Recap

previous week we went through:

* Whether or not mention the ANTLR feature in dissertaion?
    * Just mention **ANTLR is powerful**. Enable us generating the compiler components automatically without other operations.
    * **Contrast to other old tools**, when addressing the ambiguity problem, it may involve writing the rules for each alternative.**While ANTLR could resolve the ambiguity problem by left recursive**.

2. Experiment the existing Pascal grammar with exmaples from books
3. Focus the book of current stage rather than try to finish several looking once.

# Week 6 - Progress

* Finished looking in Pascal syntax (quick guide)
* Experiment with the existing Pascal grammar
    * generated parser works for several programs, 
    * but not too sure whether there are other specific things expected to do with the parser

# Questions


## Project-Related Questions

<!-- > Pascal to JVM compiler
> 
> The aim is to design and implement a compiler for the classic programming language Pascal (or another language), using Java Virtual Machine code as the target language. If time permits, language extensions can be explored.
> 
> Ideally the student will have taken PL(H). This project is an opportunity to put the concepts and techniques of that course into practice, as well as gaining an in-depth knowledge of the Java Virtual Machine.
